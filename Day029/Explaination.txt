                                Java Program to Add Two Complex Numbers by Passing Class to a Function

In this program, We will learn to add two complex numbers in Java by creating a class named Complex
 and passing it into a function add().

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

Example: Add Two Complex Numbers

In this program, we created a class Complex with two member variables: real and imag.
 As name suggests, real stores real part of a complex number and imag stores the imaginary part.

The Complex class has a constructor with initializes the value of real and imag.

We also created a new static function add() that takes two complex numbers as parameters and 
returns the result as a complex number.

Inside the add() method, we just add the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers n1 and n2,
 store it in a new variable temp and return temp.

Then, in the calling function main(), we print it using printf() function.
