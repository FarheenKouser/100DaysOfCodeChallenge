                                                      ****EXPLAINATION****    
                  Java program for the implementation of queue using double LinkedList

Insertion at Front end
1 Allocate space for a newnode of doubly linked list 
2 If newnode is equal to null then 
3 print overflow 
4 otherwise 
5 if the front is null then 
6 assign newnode to front and rear 
7 otherwise 
8 assign address of newnode to the front
9  newnode is assigned Address of pervious of front 
10 newnode is equal to front


Insertion at Rear end
1 Allocate space for a newnode of doubly linked list 
2 If newnode is equal to null then 
3 print overflow 
4 otherwise 
5 if the rear is null then 
6 assign newnode to front and rear 
7 otherwise 
8 assign address of newnode to the rear
9  newnode is assigned Address of rear next
10 newnode is equal to rear


Deletion from front end
1 If front is null
2 prin underflow 
3 otherwise
4 initialize front as temp
5 move front to front next 
6 if front is null
7 rear is null 
8 otherwise 
9 front prev as null 
10 free the space
