                        Java Program to Convert InputStream to String

In this program, you'll learn to convert input stream to a string using InputStreamReader in Java.
To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java InputStream Class
Java Strings

Example: Convert InputStream to String

In this program, the input stream is created from a String and stored in a variable stream. 
We also require a string builder sb to create the string from the stream.

Then, we created a buffered reader br from the InputStreamReader to read the lines from the stream. 
Using a while loop, we read each line and append it to the string builder. F
inally, we closed the bufferedReader.

Since, the reader can throw IOException, we have the throws IOException in the main function as:
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
