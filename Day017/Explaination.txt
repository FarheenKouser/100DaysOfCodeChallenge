                                   Java Program to Make a Simple Calculator Using switch...case

In this program, we will learn to make a simple calculator using switch..case in Java.
 This calculator would be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java switch Statement
Java Scanner Class

Here, we have used the Scanner class to take 3 inputs from the user.
operator - specifies the operation to be performed
number1/number2 - operands to perform operation on
Since the operator matches the case '*', so the corresponding codes are executed.
result = number1 * number2;
System.out.println(number + " * " + number2 + " = " + result);
break;
These statements compute the product of two numbers and print the output.
 Finally, the break statement ends the switch statement.
Similarly, for different operators, different cases are executed.
