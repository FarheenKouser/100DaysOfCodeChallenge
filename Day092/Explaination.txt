                     Java Program to Implement multiple inheritance

To understand this example, We should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Inheritance
Java Interface
Java Class and Objects

When the child class extends from more than one superclass, it is known as multiple inheritance. 
However, Java does not support multiple inheritance.
To achieve multiple inheritance in Java, we must use the interface.

Example: Multiple Inheritance in Java

In this example, we have created an interface named Backend and a class named Frontend. 
The class Language extends the Frontend class and implements the Backend interface.

Multiple Inheritancy in Java
Here, the Language class is inheriting the property of both Backend and Frontend. 
Hence, we can say it is an example of multiple inheritance.
