                                                               Java Program to convert long type variables into int

In this program, we will learn to convert the long variable into an integer (int) in Java.
To understand this example, We should have the knowledge of 
Java Data Types (Primitive)

CASE 1: Java Program to Convert long to int using Typecasting
In this case, we have long type variables a and b. Notice the lines,
int c = (int)a;
Here, the higher data type long is converted into the lower data type int. 
Hence, this is called narrowing typecasting. To learn more, visit Java Typecasting.
This process works fine when the value of the long variable is less than or equal to the maximum value of int (2147483647).
 However, if the value of the long variable is greater than the maximum int value, then there will be a loss in data.

CASE 2: long to int conversion using toIntExact()
We can also use the toIntExact() method of the Math class to convert the long value into an int.
Here, the Math.toIntExact(value1) method converts the long variable value1 into int and returns it.
The toIntExact() method throws an exception if the returned int value is not within the range of the int data type. That is,

CASE 3: Convert object of the Long class to int
In Java, we can also convert the object of wrapper class Long into an int.
 For this, we can use the intValue() method. For, example,
Here, we have created an object of the Long class named obj.
 We then used the intValue() method to convert the object into int type.
