                 Java Program to Implement the queue data structure

In this example, we will learn to implement the queue data structure in Java.

To understand this example, We should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Queue Interface-The Queue interface of the Java collections framework provides the
                                          functionality of the queue data structure. It extends the Collection interface.
                                    Since the Queue is an interface, we cannot provide the direct implementation of it.
                        In order to use the functionalities of Queue, we need to use classes that implement it:
                                                   ArrayDeque
                                                   LinkedList
                                                  PriorityQueue
                                  The Queue interface is also extended by various subinterfaces:
                                             Deque
                                            BlockingQueue
                                            BlockingDeque

Java Generics-Java Generics allows us to create a single class, interface, and method that can be used 
                            with different types of data (objects).
                               This helps us to reuse our code.
                       Note: Generics does not work with primitive types (int, float, char, etc).

Example 1: Java program to implement Stack

In this example, we have implemented the queue data structure in Java.
A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall,
 where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows FIFO rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

In programming terms, putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and 
removing items from the queue is called dequeue.

Example 2: Implement stack using Queue interface

Java provides a built Queue interface that can be used to implement a queue.
In this example, we have used the Queue interface to implement the queue in Java.
 
Here, we have used the LinkedList class that implements the Queue interface.
numbers.offer() - insert elements to the rear of the queue
numbers.poll() - remove an element from the front of the queue
Notice, we have used the angle brackets <Integer> while creating the queue. 
It represents that the queue is of the generic type.

We can also use other interfaces and classes instead of Queue and LinkedList. For example,
Deque Interface
ArrayDeque Class
PriorityQueue Class
