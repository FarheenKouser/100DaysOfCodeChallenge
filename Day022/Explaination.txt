                                              Java Program to Calculate the Execution Time of Methods

In this example, we will learn to calculate the execution time of normal methods and recursive methods in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Methods
Java Recursion

Example 1: Java Program to calculate the method execution time

In this example, we have created a method named display().
 The method prints a statement to the console. The program calculates the execution time of the method display().

Here, we have used the method nanoTime() of the System class. 
The nanoTime() method returns the current value of the running JVM in nanoseconds.

Example 2: Calculate the execution time of Recursive method.
In the above example, we are calculating the execution time of recursive method named factorial().
