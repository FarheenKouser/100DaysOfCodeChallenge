                                       Java Program to Calculate Standard Deviation

In this program, We will learn to calculate the standard deviation using a function in Java.
To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java Methods

This program calculates the standard deviation of a individual series using arrays. 
Standard Deviation-The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
                                       Its symbol is Ïƒ (the greek letter sigma)
           The formula is easy: it is the square root of the Variance.
 So now you ask, "What is the Variance?"
Variance-The Variance is defined as:
                   The average of the squared differences from the Mean.

To calculate the standard deviation, calculateSD() function is created. 
The array containing 10 elements is passed to the function and
 this function calculates the standard deviation and returns it to the main() function.

Example: Program to Calculate Standard Deviation
In this program, we've used the help of Java Math.pow() and Java Math.sqrt()
 to calculate the power and square root respectively.

Note: This program calculates the standard deviation of a sample.
 If you need to compute S.D. of a population, return Math.sqrt(standardDeviation/(length-1))
 instead of Math.sqrt(standardDeviation/length) from the calculateSD() method.
