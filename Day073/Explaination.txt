          Java Program to Implement Binary Search Algorithm

In this example, we will learn to implement binary search algorithm in Java.

To understand this example,we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java while and do...while Loop
Java if...else Statement
Java Arrays

Example: Java Program to Implement Binary Search Algorithm

Here, we have used the Java Scanner Class to take input from the user. 
Based on the input from user, we used the binary search to check if the element is present in the array.

We can also use the recursive call to perform the same task.

  int binarySearch(int array[], int element, int low, int high) {

    if (high >= low) {
      int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

      // check if mid element is searched element
      if (array[mid] == element)
        return mid;

      // Search the left half of mid
      if (array[mid] > element)
        return binarySearch(array, element, low, mid - 1);

      // Search the right half of mid
      return binarySearch(array, element, mid + 1, high);
    }

    return -1;
  }
Here, the method binarySearch() is calling itself until the element is found or, the if condition fails.
