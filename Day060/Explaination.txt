                   Java Program to Perform the preorder tree traversal

In this example, we will learn to perform the preorder tree traversal in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

Example: Java Program to perform preorder tree traversal

In this example, we have implemented the tree data structure in Java.      
Here, we are performing the preorder traversal of the tree.

Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree. 
You might, for instance, want to add all the values in the tree or find the largest one. 
For all these operations, you will need to visit each node of the tree.

Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list have only one way to read the data. 
But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.
