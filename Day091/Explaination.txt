               Java Program to Convert Milliseconds to Minutes and Seconds

In this program,we will learn to convert milliseconds to minutes and seconds individually,
 and together in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Data Types (Primitive)
Java Basic Input and Output

In Java, we can use the built-in methods:
toMinutes() - to convert milliseconds to minutes
toSeconds() - to convert milliseconds to seconds

Example 1: Milliseconds to Seconds/Minutes Using toMinutes() and toSeconds()

In this program, we have used the long datatype to store milliseconds, minutes, and 
seconds values. It is because the toMinutes() and toSeconds() methods return values in long.

Note: To use the methods, we must import the java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit package.

We can also use the basic mathematical formulas to convert milliseconds to minutes and seconds.

// convert milliseconds to seconds
Seconds = milliseconds / 1000

// convert seconds to minutes
minutes = seconds / 60

// convert millisecons to minutes
minutes = (milliseconds / 1000) / 60
