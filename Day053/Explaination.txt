                         Java Program to Detect loop in a LinkedList

In this example, we will learn to detect whether there is a loop in LinkedList in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java LinkedList-The LinkedList class of the Java collections framework provides the functionality 
                                of the linked list data structure (doubly linkedlist).

Java Methods-A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
                           In Java, there are two types of methods:
                              User-defined Methods: We can create our own method based on
                                                                           our requirements.
                             Standard Library Methods: These are built-in methods in Java that 
                                                                                   are available to use.

Example: Detect Loop in a LinkedList

In this example, we have implemented a LinkedList in Java.
 We have used Floyd's cycle finding algorithm to check if there is a loop in LinkedList.

Notice the code inside the checkLoop() method.
 Here, we have two variables named first and second that traverse the nodes in LinkedList.

first - traverse with 2 nodes at single iteration
second - traverse with 1 node at single iteration
Two nodes are traversing at different speeds. 
Hence, they will meet if there is a loop in LinkedList.
