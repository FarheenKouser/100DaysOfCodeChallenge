                Java Program to Implement stack data structure

In this example, we will learn to implement the stack data structure in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Stack Class-The Java collections framework has a class named Stack that provides 
                                  the functionality of the stack data structure.
                                 The Stack class extends the Vector class.

Java Generics-Java Generics allows us to create a single class, interface, and method that can be
                            used with different types of data (objects).
                            This helps us to reuse our code.
                     Note: Generics does not work with primitive types (int, float, char, etc).
                            We can create a class that can be used with any type of data.
                             Such a class is known as Generics Class.

Example 1: Java program to implement Stack

In this example, we have implemented the stack data structure in Java.
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
 This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

Example 2: Implement stack using Stack class
Java provides a built Stack class that can be used to implement a stack.
In this example, we have used the Stack class to implement the stack in Java. Here,
animals.push() - insert elements to top of the stack
animals.pop() - remove element from the top of the stack
Notice, we have used the angle brackets <String> while creating the stack.
 It represents that the stack is of the generic type.
