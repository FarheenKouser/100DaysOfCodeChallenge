                                     Java Program to Convert a List to Array 

In this example, we will learn to convert a Java list to an array.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java ArrayList
Java Arrays
Java List

Example 1: Convert the Java List into Array

In this example, we have created an list named languages.
 Here, we have used the ArrayList class to implement the List.

Notice the line,
languages.toArray(arr);

Here, the toArray() method converts the list languages into an array. And stores it in the string array arr.

Note: If we don't pass any argument to the toArray() method, the method returns an array of the Object type.
