                                    Java Program to Create an enum class
 
In this example, we will learn to create an enum class in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of
 the following Java programming topics:
Java enums
Java Class and Objects

Example 1: Java program to create an enum class

In this example, we have created an enum class named Size. The class contains four constants
 SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, and EXTRALARGE.

Here, the compiler automatically converts all the constants of the enum into its instances. 
Hence, we can call the method using the constant as objects.

Size.SMALL.getSize()
In this call, the this keyword is now associated with the SMALL object.
 Hence, the value small is returned.
