                             Java Program to Iterate over an ArrayList

In this example, we will learn to iterate over the elements of an arraylist in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java ArrayList
Java for Loop
Java for-each Loop
Java ListIterator Interface

Example 1: Iterate through ArrayList using for loop

In this example, we have created an arraylist named languages. 
Here, we have used the for loop to access each element of the arraylist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 2: Iterate through ArrayList using for-each loop

Here, we have used the for-each loop to iterate over the ArrayList and print each element.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3: Iterate over ArrayList using listIterator()

In this example, we have used the listIterator() method to iterate over the arraylist. 
Here,
hasNext() - returns true if there is next element in the arraylist
next() - returns the next element of the arraylist
Note: We can also use the ArrayList iterator() method and the ArrayList forEach() method
 to iterate over the arraylist.
