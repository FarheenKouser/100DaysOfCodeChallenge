                                                                            ****EXPLAINATION****
                                     Java Program to Sort Elements in Lexicographical Order (Dictionary Order)

In this program, we will learn to sort the element words in lexicographical order using a for loop and if else in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java for Loop
Java if...else Statement
Java Strings

In this  example, we have created a String array named words. The array includes 5 elements.
Here, we are using
for loops to access and compare each array element
compareTo() method to perform the comparison
Since we are sorting elements in lexicographical (dictionary) order, 
we are swapping elements if the first element comes after the second element in the dictionary.
