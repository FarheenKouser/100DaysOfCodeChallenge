                                                                                ****EXPLAINATION****
                                                                      Java Program to Check Palindrome

In this program, we wi ll learn to check whether a string or number is palindrome or not in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Strings
Java while and do...while Loop
Java for Loop
Java if...else Statement

A string is called a palindrome string if the reverse of that string is the same as the original string.
 For example, radar, level, etc.
Similarly, a number that is equal to the reverse of that same number is called a palindrome number.
 For example, 3553, 12321, etc.

To check a Palindrome in Java, we first reverse the string or number and
 compare the reversed string or number with the original value.

Example 1: Java Program to Check Palindrome String
In the above example, we have a string "Radar" stored in str. Here, we have used the
1. for loop to reverse the string
The loop runs from the end to the beginning of the string.
The charAt() method accesses each character of the string.
Each character of the string is accessed in reverse order and stored in reverseStr.
2. if statement to compare str and reverseStr
The toLowerCase() method converts both str and reverseStr to lowercase. 
This is because Java is case sensitive and 'r' and 'R' are two different values.
The equals() method checks if two strings are equal.

Example 2: Java Program to Check Palindrome Number
In the above example, we have a number 3553 stored in num and originalNum variables.
 Here, we have used the
while loop to reverse num and store the reversed number in reversedNum
if...else to check if reversedNum is same as the originalNum
