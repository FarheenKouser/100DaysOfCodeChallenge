                              Java Program to Implement Quick Sort Algorithm

In this example, we will implement the quicksort algorithm in Java.

Quicksort in Java
Quicksort algorithm is based on the divide and conquer approach where an array 
is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element.

While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way 
that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and 
elements greater than pivot are on the right side.

The same process is continued for both left and right subarrays. 
Finally, sorted elements are combined to form a sorted array.

Example: Java Program to Implement Quick Sort Algorithm

Here, the elements of the array are sorted in ascending order. 
If we want to sort the elements in descending order, then inside the for loop, 
we can change the code as:

// the less than sign is changed to greater than
if (array[j] >= pivot) {
