                                  Java Program to Sort a Map By Values

In this program, we will learn to sort a given map by values in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Map Interface
Java LinkedHashMap

In this program, we have created a LinkedHashMap named capitals.
 The map stores countries and their respective capitals.
Here, we have created a sortMap() method that takes the map and returns the sorted map.

Inside the method, we first created a list named capitalList from the map capitals. 
We then use the sort() method of Collections to sort elements of the list.

The sort() method takes two parameters: list to be sorted and a comparator.
 In our case, the comparator is a lambda expression.
(l1, l2) -> l1.getValue().compareTo(l2.getValue())
Here, the lambda expression takes two adjacent element (l1 and l2) of the list.
 It then used the getValue() method to get the value and the compareTo() method to compare two values.

After the operation, we get the sorted list capitalList. 
Then, we simply convert the list to LinkedHashMap named result and return it.
Back in the main() method, we loop through each item in the map and print its key and value.
