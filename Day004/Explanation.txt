                                                                                       ****EXPLANATION****

In this program, We will learn to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or a consotant using if..else and switch statement in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java if...else Statement
Java switch Statement


JAVA IF..ELSE STATEMENT

In this above program, 'i' is stored in a char variable ch.
 In Java, you use double quotes (" ") for strings and single quotes (' ') for characters.

Now, to check whether ch is vowel or not, we check if ch is any of: ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
 This is done using a simple if..else statement.

We can also check for vowel or consonant using a switch statement in Java.


JAVA SWITCH STATEMENT

If ch is either of cases: ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), vowel is printed.
 Else, default case is executed and consonant is printed on the screen.
