                    Java Swing Program to create a Digital watch

A digital watch is defined as a watch that displays the time in numerical digits rather than by hands on a dial.

Java's Thread and Graphics classes are used to create a digital clock. 
The Graphics class is used for the clock's design, and threads are used 
to change the clock's seconds, minutes, and hours.

ALGORITHM-
1.To create a frame, we must first import the swing package. 
2.Then, the util package will be used to build the user interface. 
3.We also use a text package to write the program where date-time is required.
4.We first create a frame and define its dimensions. 
5.We then set the values of all the variables to zero and initialize the three variables Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
6.In this software, the Calendar class is used. The abstract class that gives us access to date, time, year, and month 
   methods is the Java Calendar class.
7.The millisecond interval is provided by Sleep(1000).
