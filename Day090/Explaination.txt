                                      Java Program to Add Two Dates

In this program, we will learn to add two dates in Java using Calendar.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Class and Objects
Java Basic Input and Output

Since, Java epoch is 1970, any time represented in a Date object will not work. 
This means, your Dates will start from 1970 and when two Date objects are added, 
the sum misses by about 1970 years. So, we use Calendar instead.

Example: Java program to add two dates

In this program, c1 and c2 stores the current date. Then, we simply clone c1 and add c2's each 
DateTime properties one after the other.

As you can see, we've added 1 to the months. This is because months start with 0 in Java.

Alternatively, we can also use Joda for time/date operations in Java.
