                                                                 ****EXPLAINATION****
                                 Java Program to Check if An Array Contains a Given Value

In this program, We will learn to check if an array contains a given value in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java Data Types (Primitive)

Example 1: Check if Int Array contains a given value

In this program, we have an array of integers stored in variable num.
 Likewise, the number to be found is stored in toFind.

Now, we use a for-each loop to iterate through all elements of num and
 check individually if toFind is equal to n or not.

If yes, we set found to true and break from the loop. If not, we move to the next iteration.

Example 2: Check if an array contains the given value using Stream

In this program, instead of using a for-each loop,
 we convert the array to an IntStream and use its anyMatch() method.
anyMatch() method takes a predicate, an expression, or a function that returns a boolean value.
 In our case, the predicate compares each element n in the stream to toFind and returns true or false.

If any of the element n returns true, found is set to true as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3: Check if an array contains a given value for non-primitive types

In the above program, we've used a non-primitive data type String and 
used Arrays's stream() method to first convert it to a stream and
 anyMatch() to check if the array contains the given value toFind.
