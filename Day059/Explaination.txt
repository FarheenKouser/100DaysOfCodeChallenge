                                                            ****EXPLAINATION****
                                            Java Program to Implement Binary Tree Data Structure

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.   
Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:
1. data item
2. address of left child
3. address of right child

In this example, we will learn to implement the binary tree data structure in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

Example: Java Program to Implement Binary Tree

Binary tree implementation in Java with 4 nodes
Binary Tree Output
In this example, we have implemented the binary tree in Java.  
Unlike other data structures, Java doesn't provide a built-in class for trees.

Here, we have created our own class of BinaryTree.
