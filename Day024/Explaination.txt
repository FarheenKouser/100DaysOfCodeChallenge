                                         Java Program to Find Largest Element of an Array
 
In this program, We will learn to find the largest element in an array using a for loop in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java for-each Loop

Example: Find the largest element in an array

In the above program, we store the first element of the array in the variable largest.
Then, largest is used to compare other elements in the array.
 If any number is greater than largest, largest is assigned the number.

In this way, the largest number is stored in largest when it is printed.
