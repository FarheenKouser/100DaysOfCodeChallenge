                    Java Program to Remove duplicate elements from ArrayList

In this example, we will learn to convert the duplicate element from the ArrayList in Java.

To understand example,we should have the knowledge of following Java topics:
Java ArrayList
Java Set Interface

Example 1: Remove duplicate elements from ArrayList using Set

In this example, we have created an arraylist named numbers.
 The arraylist contains duplicate elements.

To remove duplicate elements from the arraylist, we have
add all elements from arraylist to set
empty the arraylist using clear() method
add all elements from set to arraylist

Here, we have used the LinkedHashSet to create a set. 
It is because it removes the duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.

Example 2: Remove duplicate elements from ArrayList using Stream

In this example, we have created an arraylist named numbers.
 The arraylist contains duplicate elements.

Here, we have used the Stream class to remove duplicate elements from the arraylist.
numbers.stream() - create a stream from the arraylist
stream.distinct() - removes duplicate elements
stream.collect(Collectors.toList()) - returns a list from the stream
Here, we have used typecasting to convert the returned list into an arraylist.
