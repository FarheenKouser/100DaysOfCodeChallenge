                                                                                           ****EXPLAINATION****
                                                                         Java Program to Generate Multiplication Table

In this program, we will learn to generate multiplication table of a given number.
 This is done by using a for and a while loop in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java for Loop
Java while and do...while Loop

For this we have created multiploication table by using for loop and while loop.
Though both programs are technically correct, it is better to use for loop in this case.
 It's because the number of iteration (from 1 to 10) is known.
