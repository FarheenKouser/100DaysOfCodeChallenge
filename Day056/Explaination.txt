                           Java Program to Calculate the difference between two sets

In this example, we will learn to calculate the difference between two sets in Java.

To understand this example,we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Set Interface
Java HashSet Class

Example 1: Calculate the difference between two sets

In this example, we have created two sets named numbers and primeNumbers.    
We have implemented the set using the HashSet class.
 Notice the line,
numbers.retainAll(primeNumbers);
Here, we have used the removeAll() method to calculate the difference between two sets.

Example 2: Get difference between two sets using Guava Library

In this example, we have used the Guava library to get the difference between two sets.
In order to run this program, we need to implement Guava Library by adding it in your dependency.

Here, we have used the difference() method of the Sets class present in the Guava library.
