                          Java Program to Add Two Matrix Using Multi-dimensional Arrays

In this program, We will learn to add two matrices using multi-dimensional arrays in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java for Loop

Example: Program to Add Two Matrices

In this program, the two matrices are stored in 2d array, namely firstMatrix and secondMatrix.
 We've also defined the number of rows and columns and stored them in variables rows and columns respectively.

Then, we initialize a new array of the given rows and columns called sum. 
This matrix array stores the addition of the given matrices.

We loop through each index of both arrays to add and store the result.

Finally, we loop through each element in the sum array using the for-each loop to print the elements.
