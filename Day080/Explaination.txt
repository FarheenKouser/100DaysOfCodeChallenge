                                  Java program to implement Bucket Sort Algorithm

BUCKET SORT-
Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted array elements into several 
groups called buckets. Each bucket is then sorted by using any of the suitable sorting 
algorithms or recursively applying the same bucket algorithm.

Finally, the sorted buckets are combined to form a final sorted array.

Working of Bucket Sort-
1.Suppose, the input array is of N size
    Create an array of size 10. 
     Each slot of this array is used as a bucket for storing elements.

2.Insert elements into the buckets from the array. 
    The elements are inserted according to the range of the bucket.

3.The elements of each bucket are sorted using any of the stable sorting algorithms. 
    Here, we have used quicksort (inbuilt function).

4.The elements from each bucket are gathered.

It is done by iterating through the bucket and inserting an individual element into 
the original array in each cycle. 
The element from the bucket is erased once it is copied into the original array.
