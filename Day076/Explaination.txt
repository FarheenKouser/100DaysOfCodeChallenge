              Java Program to Implement Merge Sort Algorithm

Merge Sort in Java
The merge sort algorithm is based on the principle of divide and conquer algorithm 
where a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. 
Each sub-problem is solved individually and finally, 
sub-problems are combined to form the final solutions.

Example: Java Program to Implement Merge Sort Algorithm

Here, the elements of the array are sorted in ascending order. 
If we want to sort the elements in descending order, then inside the first 
while loop of the merge() method, 

we can change the code as:
// the less than sign is changed to greater than
if (L[i] >= M[j]) {
