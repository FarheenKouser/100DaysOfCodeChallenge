                                                          Java Program to Find G.C.D Using Recursion

In this program, We will learn to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF using a recursive function in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Methods
Java Recursion

This program takes two positive integers and calculates GCD using recursion.
The HCF or GCD of two integers is the largest integer that can exactly divide both numbers 
(without a remainder).

In this program, the recursive function is called until n2 is 0.
 In the end, the value of n1 is the GCD or HCF of the given two numbers.
