                                          Java Program to Find Transpose of a Matrix
 
In this program, We will learn to find and print the transpose of a given matrix in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java Multidimensional Arrays
Java Methods

Transpose of a matrix is the process of swapping the rows to columns. For 2x3 matrix,

Matrix
a11    a12    a13
a21    a22    a23

Transposed Matrix
a11    a21
a12    a22
a13    a23

Example: Program to Find Transpose of a Matrix

In this program, display() function is only used to print the contents of a matrix to the screen.
Here, the given matrix is of form 2x3, i.e. row = 2 and column = 3.
For the transposed matrix, we change the order of transposed to 3x2, i.e. row = 3 and column = 2. 
So, we have transpose = int[column][row]

The transpose of the matrix is calculated by simply swapping columns to rows:
transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
