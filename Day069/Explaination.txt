                               Implementation of Queue Using Circular Double LinkedList

Enqueue

1 allocate space for a ptr of stack linked list .

2 If ptr is null then

3 data of pointer is x

4 front  is assigned to  pointer next

5 pointer assigned to is pointer pervious

6 front and rear is equal to pointer

7 otherwise

8  data of pointer is x

9 rear  is assigned to  pointer next

10 rear next  assigned to is pointer

11 pointer pervious is equal to rear

12 pointer is assigned to rear and the front pervious is assigned to pointer.

 

Dequeue

1 if front is null

2 print underflow

3 else if

4  print the data in the front

5 rear is equal to front

6 otherwise

7 initialize  temp to front

8 rear next to front next

9 Front to the front next

10 rear is assigned to front pervious

11 print temp data

12  free the space .
