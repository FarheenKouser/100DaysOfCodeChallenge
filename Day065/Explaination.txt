                                              ****EXPLAINATION****
                     Java Program to Remove elements from the LinkedList.

In this example, we will learn to remove elements from the Java LinkedList using different methods.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java LinkedList-The LinkedList class of the Java collections framework provides 
                                 the functionality of the linked list data structure (doubly linkedlist).
                               A single node of doubly linkedlist that has 3 fields Prev, Data, and Next.
          Java Doubly LinkedList
                  Each element in a linked list is known as a node. It consists of 3 fields:
                          Prev - stores an address of the previous element in the list. It is null for the first element
                         Next - stores an address of the next element in the list. It is null for the last element
                         Data - stores the actual data
        
Java ListIterator Interface-The ListIterator interface of the Java collections framework provides 
                                                    the functionality to access elements of a list.
                                                It is bidirectional. 
                                               This means it allows us to iterate elements of a list in both the direction.
                          It extends the Iterator interface.

Example 1: Remove element using remove()

In the above example, we have created a linkedlist named languages. 
Here, the remove() method to remove an element from the linkedlist.
The method takes the index number of the element as its parameter.

Example 2 Using listIterator() Method

We can also the listsIterator() to remove elements from the linkedlist.
In this example, the listIterator() method returns an iterator to access each element of the linkedlist.
Here, the next() method returns the next element in the linkedlist.
