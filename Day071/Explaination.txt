                     Java Programme to Implement Stack using Circular LinkedList

1 create data and a pointer

2 define insert method which contains head and tail as null

3 If head and tail is null then assign the head value  to the ptr then ptr next value is assigned
     to head

4 If ptr next is head then head is assigned to ptr  tail next is ptr and the x is given to data 
   call the delete function

5 if head is equal to the tail then assign null to head . Assign null to tail.

6 checking if the stack is empty or full if tail and head is null the stack is empty 
  then head is assigned to ptr and ptr next is assigned to ptr and ptr next is assigned to head ,
   tail next is assigned by head.
