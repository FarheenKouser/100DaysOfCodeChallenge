                     Java Program to Implement Bubble Sort algorithm

In this example, we will learn to execute bubble sort algorithm in Java.

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and 
swaps them until they are in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, 
each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. 
Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

Example: Java Program to Implement Bubble Sort Algorithm

Output 1
Choose Sorting Order:
1 for Ascending 
2 for Descending
1
Sorted Array:
[-9, -2, 0, 11, 45]
In this case, we have entered 1 as input. Hence, the program sort the array in ascending order.

Output 2
Choose Sorting Order:
1 for Ascending
2 for Descending
2
Sorted Array:
[45, 11, 0, -2, -9]
In this case, we have entered 2 as input. Hence, the program sort the array in descending order.
