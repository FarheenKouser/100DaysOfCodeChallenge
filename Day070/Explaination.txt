                                    Java Programme to implement Stack using LinkedList

Push
1.	Allocate space for a for pointer of the stack linked list.
2.	 check is the pointer is null 
3.	 then print the overflow means full
4.	 otherwise
5.	 assign x to the data of the node
6.	 traverse the temp to the top 
7.	 assign temp value to top

  POP
     1. if front pointer is equal to null
2. print underflow means empty 
      3. otherwise
      4. the top next pointer is assigned to top pointer 
      5. free the space 

PRINT 
      1. If top is equal to null 
      2. print underflow 
      3. otherwise 
      4. assign the top address to temp
      5. till temp is not equal to null 
      6. print the data 
      7. till temp is not equal to null traverse the node .
