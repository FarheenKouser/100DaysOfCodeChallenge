                                    Java Program to Compute all the permutations of the string

In this example, we will learn to compute all the permutations of the string in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Strings
Java Recursion
Java Scanner Class

Permutation of the string means all the possible new strings that can be formed by interchanging
 the position of the characters of the string.

 For example, string ABC has permutations [ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA].
In Java, we have used the recursion to compute all the permutations of a string.
 Here, we store the permutation in a set. So, there will be no duplicate permutation.
