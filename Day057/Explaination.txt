                            Java Program to Check if a set is the subset of another set

In this example, we will learn to check if a set is the subset of another set in Java.

To understand this example, We have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Set Interface
Java HashSet Class
Java TreeSet

The TreeSet class of the Java collections framework provides the functionality of a tree data structure.

Example 1: Check subset of a Set using HashSet class

In this example, we have created two sets named numbers and primeNumbers.
 We have implemented the set using the HashSet class.
 Notice the line,
numbers.containsAll(primeNumbers);
Here, we have used the containsAll() method to check if primeNumbers is the subset of numbers.

Example 2: Check subset of a Set using TreeSet class

Here, we have implemented the set using the TreeSet class.
In order to create a tree set, we must import the java.util.TreeSet package first.
Once we import the package, here is how we can create a TreeSet in Java.
TreeSet<Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>();
Here, we have created a TreeSet without any arguments.
 In this case, the elements in TreeSet are sorted naturally (ascending order).

However, we can customize the sorting of elements by using the Comparator interface.
