                                Java Program to Create File 

JAVA FILE CLASS-
The File class of the java.io package is used to perform various operations on files and directories.
There is another package named java.nio that can be used to work with files.

Example 1: Java Program to Create a File

In this example, we have created a file object named file. The file object is linked with the specified path.
// javaFile.java is equivalent to
// currentdirectory/JavaFile.java
File file = new File("JavaFile.java");
We then use the createNewFile() method of the File class to create new file to the specified path.

Note: If the file JavaFile.java is not already present, then only the new file is created. 
Otherwise the program returns The file already exists.
