                                          Java Program to Calculate Average Using Arrays

In this program, we will learn to calculate the average of the given arrays in Java.
To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Arrays
Java for-each Loop

Example: Program to Calculate Average Using Arrays

In this program, the numArray stores the floating-point values whose average is to be found.
Then, to calculate the average, we need to first calculate the sum of all elements in the array. 
This is done using a for-each loop in Java.
Finally, we calculate the average by the formula:
average = sum of numbers / total count
In this case, the total count is given by numArray.length.
Finally, we print the average using format() function so that we limit the decimal points to only 2 using "%.2f"
