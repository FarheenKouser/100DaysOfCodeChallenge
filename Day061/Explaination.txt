                   Java Program to Perform the postorder tree traversal

In this example, we will learn to perform the postorder tree traversal in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree. You might, for instance, 
want to add all the values in the tree or find the largest one.  
For all these operations, you will need to visit each node of the tree. 

Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list have only one way  
to read the data.  
But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways. 

Example: Java Program to perform postorder tree traversal

In this example, we have implemented the tree data structure in Java.
Here, we are performing the postorder traversal of the tree.
