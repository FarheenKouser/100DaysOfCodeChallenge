             Java Program to Implement the graph data structure

In this example, we will implement the graph data structure in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

Example: Implement Graph Data Structure

In the above example, we have implemented the graph data structure in Java. 

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

Let's try to understand this through an example. 
On facebook, everything is a node. 
That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...
anything that has data is a node.

Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. 
Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship.
