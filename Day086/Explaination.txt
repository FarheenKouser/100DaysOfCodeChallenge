             Java Program to Count number of lines present in the file

In this example, we will learn to count the number of lines present in a file in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java File Class
Java Scanner Class

Example 1: Java program to count the number of lines in a file using Scanner class

In this example,
 we have used the nextLine() method of the Scanner class to access each line of the file. 
Here, depending on the number of lines the file input.txt file contains, the program shows the output.

In this case, we have a file name input.txt with the following content
First Line
Second Line
Third Line

So, we will get output
Total Number of Lines: 3

Example 2: Java program to count the number of lines in a file using java.nio.file package

In this above example,
lines() - read all lines of the file as a stream
count() - returns the number of elements in the stream
Here, if the file input.txt contains the following content:

This is the article on Java Examples.
The examples count number of lines in a file.
Here, we have used the java.nio.file package.
The program will print Total Lines: 3.
