                          Java Program to Iterate over a HashMap

In this example, we will learn to iterate over keys, values, and key/value mappings of a Java HashMap.

To understand this example,we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java HashMap
Java for-each Loop
Java Iterator Interface
In Java HashMap, we can iterate through its keys, values, and key/value mappings.

Example 1: Iterate through HashMap using the forEach loop

In this example, we have created a hashmap named languages. 
Here, we have used the forEach loop to iterate through the elements of the hashmap.

Notice that we are independently iterating through the keys, values, and key/value mappings.

languages.entrySet() - returns the set view of all the entries
languages.keySet() - returns the set view of all the keys
languages.values() - returns the set view of all the values
Note: We have used the Map.Entry class. It is the nested class that returns a view of the map.

Example 2: Iterate through HashMap using iterator()

In this example, we are iterating through keys, values, and key/value mappings of the hash map.
 We have used the iterator() method to iterate over the hashmap.
 Here,
hasNext() - returns true if there is next element in the hashmap
next() - returns the next element of the hashmap
Note: We can also use the HashMap forEach() method to iterate over the hashmap.
