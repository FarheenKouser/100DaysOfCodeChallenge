                            Java Program to Get Current Working Directory

In this program, we'll learn to get the current working directory in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java File Class
Java Strings

Example 1: Get current working directory

In the above program, we used System's getProperty() method to get the user.dir property of the program. 
This returns the directory which contains our Java project.

Example 2: Get the current working directory using Path

In the above program, we used Path's get() method to get the current path of our program. 
This returns a relative path to the working directory.

We then change the relative path to an absolute path using toAbsolutePath(). 
Since it returns a Path object, we need to change it to a string using toString() method.
