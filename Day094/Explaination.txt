                  Java Program to Determine the name and version of the operating system

In this example, we will learn to get the name and version of operating system 
in which the program run using Java.

Example: Determine the Operating System

In this example, we have used the getProperty() method of the System class. 
Here, we have passed the os.name key as an argument to the method.

The method returns the property of the system specified by the key.

There are other keys that can be used to get other system properties. 
For example,
// returns the version of Operating system
// 10.0
System.getProperty("os.version");
Here, the key os.version returns the version of the operating system.
