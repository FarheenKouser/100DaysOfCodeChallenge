                       Java Program to Sort map by keys

In this example, we will learn to sort the map by keys in Java.

To understand this example, We should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Map Interface-The Map interface of the Java collections framework provides the functionality
                                      of the map data structure.
                        Working of Map-
                                     In Java, elements of Map are stored in key/value pairs.
                                     Keys are unique values associated with individual Values.
                              A map cannot contain duplicate keys. 
                              And, each key is associated with a single value.

Java HashMap-The HashMap class of the Java collections framework provides the functionality
                             of the hash table data structure.
                              It stores elements in key/value pairs.
                             Here, keys are unique identifiers used to associate each value on a map.
                             The HashMap class implements the Map interface.

Java TreeMap-The TreeMap class of the Java collections framework provides the tree 
                            data structure implementation.
                            It implements the NavigableMap interface.

Example: Sort a map by keys using TreeMap

In this example, we have created a map named languages using HashMap. 
Here, the map is not sorted.

To sort the map, we created a treemap from the map.
 Now, the map is sorted by its keys.
