                         Java Program to implement Heap Sort Algorithm

HEAP SORT-
Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in computer programming. 
Learning how to write the heap sort algorithm requires knowledge of 
two types of data structures - 
arrays and trees.

Heap sort works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of 
complete binary tree called a heap.

Working of Heap Sort
1.Since the tree satisfies Max-Heap property, then the largest item is stored at the root node.
2.Swap: Remove the root element and put at the end of the array (nth position) 
   Put the last item of the tree (heap) at the vacant place.
3.Remove: Reduce the size of the heap by 1.
4.Heapify: Heapify the root element again so that we have the highest element at root.
5.The process is repeated until all the items of the list are sorted.
