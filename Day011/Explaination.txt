                                                                                                  ****EXPLAINATION****
                                                                                  Java Program to Find Factorial of a Number

In this program, We will learn to find the factorial of a number using for and while loop in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java for Loop
Java while and do...while Loop

The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n

EXAMPLE 1:
In this program, we've used for loop to loop through all numbers between 1 and the given number num (10), 
and the product of each number till num is stored in a variable factorial.
We've used long instead of int to store large results of factorial.


EXAMPLE 2: 
In the above program, unlike a for loop, we have to increment the value of i inside the body of the loop.
Though both programs are technically correct, it is better to use for loop in this case.
 It's because the number of iteration (upto num) is known.
