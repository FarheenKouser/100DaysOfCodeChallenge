                  Java Program to Calculate the intersection of two sets

In this example, we will learn to calculate the intersection of two sets in Java.

To understand this example,we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Set Interface
Java HashSet Class

Example 1: Calculate the intersection of two sets

In this example, we have created two sets named primeNumbers and evenNumbers. 
We have implemented the set using the HashSet class.
 Notice the line,
evenNumbers.retainAll(primeNumbers);
Here, we have used the retainAll() method to get the intersection of two sets.

Example 2: Get union of two sets using Guava Library

In this example, we have used the Guava library to get the intersection of two sets. 
In order to run this program, you need to implement Guava Library by adding it to your dependency.

Here, we have used the intersection() method of the Sets class present in the Guava library.
