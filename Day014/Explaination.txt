                                                                       Java Program to Reverse a Number

In this program, we will learn to reverse a number using a while loop and a for loop in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java while and do...while Loop
Java for Loop

Example 1: Reverse a Number using a while loop in Java

In this program, while loop is used to reverse a number as given in the following steps:

First, the remainder of the num divided by 10 is stored in the variable digit.
 Now, the digit contains the last digit of num, i.e. 4.
digit is then added to the variable reversed after multiplying it by 10.
 Multiplication by 10 adds a new place in the reversed number. 
One-th place multiplied by 10 gives you tenth place, tenth gives you hundredth, and so on.
 In this case, reversed contains 0 * 10 + 4 = 4.
num is then divided by 10 so that now it only contains the first three digits: 123.
After second iteration, digit equals 3, reversed equals 4 * 10 + 3 = 43 and num = 12
After third iteration, digit equals 2, reversed equals 43 * 10 + 2 = 432 and num = 1
After fourth iteration, digit equals 1, reversed equals 432 * 10 + 1 = 4321 and num = 0
Now num = 0, so the test expression num != 0 fails and while loop exits.
 reversed already contains the reversed number 4321.

Example 2: Reverse a number using a for loop in Java

In the above program, the while loop is replaced by a for loop where:

no initialization expression is used
test expression remains the same (num != 0)
update/increment expression contains num /= 10.
So, after each iteration, the update expression runs which removes the last digit of num.

When the for loop exits, reversed will contain the reversed number.
