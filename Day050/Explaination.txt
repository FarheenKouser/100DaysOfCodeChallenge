                               Java Program to Iterate over a Set

In this example, we will learn to iterate over the elements of a set in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java HashSet Class-The HashSet class of the Java Collections framework provides the functionalities
                                       of the hash table data structure.
                                      It implements the Set interface.

Java Iterator Interface-The Iterator interface of the Java collections framework allows us to access
                                             elements of a collection. It has a subinterface ListIterator.

Java for-each Loop-In Java, the for-each loop is used to iterate through elements of arrays and 
                                       collections (like ArrayList). It is also known as the enhanced for loop.
                      The syntax of the Java for-each loop is:
                                     for(dataType item : array) {  ...  }
                        Here,
                            array - an array or a collection
                            item - each item of array/collection is assigned to this variable
                           dataType - the data type of the array/collection

Example 1: Iterate through Set using the forEach loop

In this example, we have created a set using the HashSet class. 
Here, we have used the for-each loop to iterate each element of the set.

Example 2: Iterate through Set using iterator()

In this example, we have used the HashSet class to create a set. 
We have used the iterator() method to iterate over the set. 
Here,
hasNext() - returns true if there is next element in the set
next() - returns the next element of the set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3: Iterate through Set using forEach() method

In this example, we have created a set named numbers using the HashSet class. 
Notice the code,
numbers.forEach((e) -> {
  System.out.print(e + " ");
});
Here, we have used the forEach() method to access each element of the set. 
The method takes the lambda expressions as it's argument.
