                                Java Program to Implement switch statement on strings

In this example, we will learn to implement the switch statement on strings in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java switch Statement
Java Strings

The switch statement- allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.
The syntax of the switch statement in Java is:

switch (expression) {

  case value1:
    // code
    break;
  
  case value2:
    // code
    break;
  
  ...
  ...
  
  default:
    // default statements
  }

How does the switch-case statement work?
The expression is evaluated once and compared with the values of each case.

If expression matches with value1, the code of case value1 are executed. 
Similarly, the code of case value2 is executed if expression matches with value2.
If there is no match, the code of the default case is executed.
