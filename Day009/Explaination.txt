                                                          Java Program to Remove All Whitespaces from a String

In this program, We will learn to remove all whitespaces in a given string using regular expressions in Java.
To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Strings
Java Basic Input and Output

CASE1:
In this program, we use String's replaceAll() method to remove and replace all whitespaces in the string sentence.
We've used regular expression \\s that finds all white space characters (tabs, spaces, new line character, etc.) in the string.
 Then, we replace it with "" (empty string literal).

CASE 2:
 Take string from users and remove the white space
In this program, we have used the Java Scanner to take input from the user.
Here, the replaceAll() method replaces all the white spaces from the string.
