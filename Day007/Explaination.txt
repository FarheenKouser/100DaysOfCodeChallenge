                                                                                               ****EXPLAINATION****

                                                                                        Java Program to Check Leap Year

In this program, We will learn to check if the given year is a leap year or not. This is checked using a if else statement.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Operators
Java if...else Statement

A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.

In this example, we are checking if the year 1900 is a leap year or not. 
Since 1900 is a century year (ending with 00), it should be divisible by both 4 and 400 to be a leap year.
However, 1900 is not divisible by 400. Hence, it is not a leap year.
