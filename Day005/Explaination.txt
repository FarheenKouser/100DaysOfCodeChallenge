                                                                                                          ****EXPLAINATION****

                                                                         Java Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers

In this program, We will learn to find the largest among three numbers using if else and nested if..else statement in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Operators
Java if...else Statement


METHOD1:
In this program, three numbers -4.5, 3.9 and 2.5 are stored in variables n1, n2 and n3 respectively.

Then, to find the largest, the following conditions are checked using if else statements

If n1 is greater or equals to both n2 and n3, n1 is the greatest.
If n2 is greater or equals to both n1 and n3, n2 is the greatest.
Else, n3 is the greatest.
The greatest number can also be found using a nested if..else statement.


METHOD2:
In this program, instead of checking for two conditions in a single if statement, we use nested if to find the greatest.

Then, to find the largest, the following conditions are checked using if else statements

If n1 is greater or equals to n2,
and if n1 is greater or equals to n3, n1 is the greatest.
else, n3 is the greatest.
Else,
if n2 is greater or equals to both n3, n2 is the greatest.
else, n3 is the greatest.
