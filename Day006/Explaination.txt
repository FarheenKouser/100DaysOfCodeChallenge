Java Program to Find all Roots of a Quadratic Equation

In this program, We will learn to find all roots of a quadratic equation and print them using format() in Java.

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:
ax2 + bx + c = 0
Here, a, b, and c are real numbers and a can't be equal to 0.

We can calculate the root of a quadratic by using the formula:
x = (-b ± √(b2-4ac)) / (2a)

The ± sign indicates that there will be two roots:
root1 = (-b + √(b2-4ac)) / (2a)
root1 = (-b - √(b2-4ac)) / (2a)

The term b2-4ac is known as the determinant of a quadratic equation. It specifies the nature of roots. That is,
if determinant > 0, roots are real and different
if determinant == 0, roots are real and equal
if determinant < 0, roots are complex complex and different

      
 
In this program, the coefficients a, b, and c are set to 2.3, 4, and 5.6 respectively. Then, the determinant is calculated as b2 - 4ac.

Based on the value of the determinant, the roots are calculated as given in the formula above. Notice we've used library function Math.sqrt() to calculate the square root of a number.

We have used the format() method to print the calculated roots.
