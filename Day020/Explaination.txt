                                                Java Program to Call One Constructor from another

In this example, we will learn how we can call one constructor from another constructor in Java.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java Constructors
Java Methods

Example 1: Java program to call one constructor from another
In this example, we have created a class named Main.
 Here, you have created two constructors inside the Main class.
Main() {..}
Main(int arg1, int arg2) {...}
Inside the first constructor, we have used this keyword to call the second constructor.
this(5, 2);
Here, the second constructor is called from the first constructor by passing arguments 5 and 2.

Note: The line inside a constructor that calls another constructor should be the first line of the constructor. 
That is, this(5, 2) should be the first line of Main().

Example 2: Call the constructor of the superclass from the constructor of the child class
We can also call the constructor of the superclass from the constructor of child class using super().
In the above example, we have created a superclass named Languages and a subclass Main.
 Inside the constructor of the Main class, notice the line,
super(11, 8);
Here, we are calling the constructor of the superclass (i.e. Languages(int version1, int version2))
 from the constructor of the subclass (Main()).
