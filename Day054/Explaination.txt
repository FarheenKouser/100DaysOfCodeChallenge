                            Java Program to Calculate union of two sets

In this example, we will learn to calculate the union of two sets in Java.

To understand this example, We should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Set Interface-The Set interface of the Java Collections framework provides the features 
                                    of the mathematical set in Java. 
                                    It extends the Collection interface.
                                    Unlike the List interface, sets cannot contain duplicate elements.

Java HashSet Class-The HashSet class of the Java Collections framework provides 
                                      the functionalities of the hash table data structure.
                                      It implements the Set interface.

Example 1: Calculate the union of two sets using addAll()

In this example, we have created two sets named evenNumbers and numbers.
 We have implemented the set using the HashSet class. 
Notice the line,
numbers.addAll(evenNumbers);
Here, we have used the addAll() method to get the union of two sets.

Example 2: Get union of two sets using Guava Library

In this example, we have used the Guava library to get the union of two sets.
In order to run this program, we need to implement Guava Library by adding it in your dependency.

Here, we have used the union() method of the Sets class present in the Guava library.
