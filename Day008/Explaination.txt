                                                                                                     ****EXPLAINATION****
                                                                          Java Program to Find the Frequency of Character in a String

In this program,  we will learn to find the occurence (frequency) of a character in a given string.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java if...else Statement
Java for Loop
Java String charAt()

In this program, the length of the given string, str, is found using the string method length().
We loop through each character in the string using charAt() function which takes the index (i) and 
returns the character in the given index.
We compare each character to the given character ch. 
If it's a match, we increase the value of frequency by 1.
In the end, we get the total occurrence of a character stored in frequency and print it.
