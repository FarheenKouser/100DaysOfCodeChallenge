                     Java Program to Merge two lists

In this example, we will learn to merge two lists with the help of the addAll() method and the Stream class in Java.

To understand this example,we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
Java ArrayList
Java List

Example 1: Merge two lists using addAll()

In this example, have two lists named prime and even.
 Here, we have used the Java ArrayList addAll() method to add all elements
 from prime and even to the new list named numbers.

Example 2: Merge two lists using the Stream class

In this example, we have used the Stream class to merge the two lists.
 Here,
stream() - converts the list into a stream
concat() - merges the two streams
collect(Collectors.toList()) - convert the stream into a list.
