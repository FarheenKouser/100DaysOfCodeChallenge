                               Java Program to Convert Map (HashMap) to List

In this program, We will learn different techniques to convert a map to a list in Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

1.Java Map Interface-The Map interface of the Java collections framework provides
                                      the functionality of the map data structure.
                                     In Java, elements of Map are stored in key/value pairs.
                                     Keys are unique values associated with individual Values.
                                      A map cannot contain duplicate keys.
                                     And, each key is associated with a single value.

2. Java HashMap-The HashMap class of the Java collections framework provides
                               the functionality of the hash table data structure.
                                It stores elements in key/value pairs. 
                           Here, keys are unique identifiers used to associate each value on a map.
                              The HashMap class implements the Map interface.

3.Java List-In Java, the List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to 
                      store and access elements sequentially. It extends the Collection interface.

4.Java ArrayList-In Java, we use the ArrayList class to implement the
                                 functionality of resizable-arrays.
                                 It implements the List interface of the collections framework.

Example 1: Convert Map to List

In this program, we have a map of Integer and String named map. 
Since the map contains a key, value pair, we need two lists to store each of them, 
namely keyList for keys and valueList for values.

We used map's keySet() method to get all the keys and created an ArrayList keyList from them.
 Likewise, we used the map's values() method to get all the values and
 created an ArrayList valueList from them.

Example 2: Convert Map to List using stream

In this program, instead of using ArrayList constructor, we've used stream() to convert the map to a list.

We've converted the keys and values to stream and convert it to a list using 
collect() method passing Collectors' toList() as a parameter.
