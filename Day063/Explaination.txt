         Java Program to Count number of leaf nodes in a tree

In this example, we will learn to count the number of leaf nodes in a tree using Java.

To understand this example, we should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

Java Class and Objects
Java Methods

A node is a leaf node if both left and right child nodes of it are NULL. 
Here is an algorithm to get the leaf node count.

getLeafCount(node)
1) If node is NULL then return 0.
2) Else If left and right child nodes are NULL return 1.
3) Else recursively calculate leaf count of the tree using below formula.
    Leaf count of a tree = Leaf count of left subtree + 
                                 Leaf count of right subtree

Example: Java Program to count the number of leaf nodes in a tree

In the above example, we have implemented the tree data structure in Java. 
Here, we are using recursion to count the number of leaf nodes in the tree.
